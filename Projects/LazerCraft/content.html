<h1>Lazer Craft (2013)</h1>

<p class="italic">"In this game, chickens shoot lasers out of their beaks, what more could you want? Watch your back though because every projectile reflects off walls in this multiplayer 2D platformer."</p>

<p>Lazer Craft was a video game developed in XNA/C#. It was my first serious game development project, and much of my time was spent learning both how to code and work with game engines</p>

<p>During the project's development I was able to create:</p>

<ul>
    <li>An entity-component system</li>
    <li>A physics engine</li>
    <li>A level creator, with exporting and importing functionality</li>
    <li>Networked gameplay</li>
</ul>
