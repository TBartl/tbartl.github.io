<h1>Genevolution (2018)</h1>

<p class="italic">"With only 6 seconds to live, will you be able to transfer your genes in this hectic platformer?"</p>

<p>Genevolution was a video game developed in Unity/C# for the 2018 Global Game Jam, a 48 hour Game Jam competition.</p>

<p>I worked on a team of 5, focusing on the game's core platforming mechanics and art style.</p>

<p>The game ultimately won 2nd place among 15 teams for game feel and polish.</p>
