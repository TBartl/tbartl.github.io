<h1>Sonder (2016)</h1>

<p class="italic">"As the world crumbles and is flooded with monsters, the only one you can trust is yourself. Scavenge broken cities for unique
    items that will let you withstand the horrors and other players. Only one can survive."</p>

<p>Sonder is a 3D multiplayer roguelike developed in Unity/C#. The goal of the project was to gain experience with larger projects
    and networking.</p>

<p>I worked on the project daily for 120 days, releasing an update video at the end of each month.</p>
