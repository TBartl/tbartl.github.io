<h1>Metroid Clone (2016)</h1>

<p class="italic">"Brave through the fortress planet Zebes in this faithful recreation of the original Metroid"</p>

<p>Metroid (Clone) was a remake of the original Metroid game for the NES. The game was created in Unity/C# for an EECS 494: Game Design and Development project.</p>

<p>I used the scrum methodology to rebuild the game from the ground up with my team, faithfully recreating all of the original mechanics.</p>

<p>Our team recieved an A+ on the project</p>

<p>After becoming an Instruction Aide for the course, I worked to overhaul the tools and tutorial for the project to make it more productive as a learning tool</p>
