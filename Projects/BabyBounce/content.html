<h1>Baby Bounce (2018)</h1>

<p class="italic">"It's time to play a game. A game about a baby. And a baby with spikes. It's Baby Bounce!."</p>

<p>Baby Bounce was a video game developed in Unity/C# for Wolverine Soft's 2018 Shammy Jam, a 42 hour Game Jam competition.</p>

<p>I worked to build a game from scratch in the limited time span, implementing everything from the mechanics to the visuals and audio.</p>

<p>The game ultimately won 2nd place among 11 teams for its art style and shock value.</p>
