<h1>Infinite Space (2015)</h1>

<p class="italic">"The final frontier is filled all sorts of crazy characters. Grab some friends and take control of a single space ship using your smartphone, but make sure to watch the ship status on the projector!"</p>

<p>Infinite Space was a collaborative game available in the CCA area of the Duderstadt Center in late 2015. Part of the game was displayed with a projector aimed at the ceiling of the building. Users interacted with the game through their smartphone's browser.</p>
    
<p>The game itself was made in Unity/C#. The controllers were made using HTML/CSS/JavaScript and sockets through AirConsole. The projection was done using TouchDesigner with Spout to transfer rendering from Unity.</p>

<p>The project was developed while I was an Emerging Technologies Consultant at the Groundworks Media Lab on a team with 8 other consultants of various disciplines.</p>
