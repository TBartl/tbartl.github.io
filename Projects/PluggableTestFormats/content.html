<h1>Pluggable Test Formats (2016)</h1>

<p class="italic">"With pluggable test formats, we can decouple each format from the test environment allowing us to test only the formats needed."</p>

<p>Pluggable test formats was a project I worked on during my first internship as a Software Developer on the Autodesk Translation Framework team, the team responsible for input/export of various 3D formats.</p>

<p>I overhauled part of ATF's internal testing environment to make each format pluggable, meaning each format was able to be used without the need of other formats.</p>

<p>The project was written entirely in C++.</p>

<p>In total 16 file formats were overhauled for improved flexibility including standard formats such as OBJ and XML and newer formats such as 3MF and Autodesk Stingray.</p>
