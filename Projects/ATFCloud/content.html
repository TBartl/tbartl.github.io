<h1>ATF Cloud (2017)</h1>

<p class="italic">"Get the file translation power of Autodesk applications like Maya or Inventor in your browser."</p>

<p>ATF Cloud was a project I worked on during my second internship as a Software Developer on the Autodesk Translation Framework team, the team responsible for input/export of various 3D formats.</p>

<p>The goal was to make an web application that supported the full translation services of ATF without needing to download anything.</p>

<p>The project was leveraged a number of different technologies. The backend was made with Node.js and the ATF library. The frontend was made with HTML/CSS/JavaScript using Angular and the Autodesk Forge APIs</p>

<p>By the end of my internship ATF cloud supported 15 different formats with over 400 settings.</p>
