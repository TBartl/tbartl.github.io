<h1>ChronoCursor (2016)</h1>

<p class="italic">"Work with your past self to solve puzzles as you rewind and interact with playbacks of your last cursors."</p>

<p>ChronoCursor was a video game developed in Unity/C# for EECS 494: Game Design and Development.</p>

<p>The game featured a time rewind mechanic that perfectly replayed a user's past actions, allowing for psuedo time travel.</p>

<p>I recieved an A+ on the project for it's unique mechanic and finished features.</p>
