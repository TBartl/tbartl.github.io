<h1>Cloud Chaser (2017)</h1>

<p class="italic">"Your crush demands flowers, but they are scattered on clouds thousands of feet above the ground. Armed with your trusty grappling hook, you must navigate the skies or suffer a fate worse than death: the friendzone."</p>

<p>Cloud Chaser was a video game developed in Unity/C# for Wolverine Soft's 2017 Shammy Jam, a 48 hour Game Jam competition.</p>

<p>I worked on a team of four to build a game from scratch in just 48 hours. I was primarily responsible for programming and implementing art.</p>

<p>We won 1st place for the game's unique mechanic, charming art-style, original game assets, and level design..</p>
