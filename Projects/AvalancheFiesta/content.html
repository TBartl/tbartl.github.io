<h1>Avalanche Fiesta (2013)</h1>

<p class="italic">"The lava is rising, you're under attack by a floating head, and you forgot your bowtie! Your only hope is to hop onto falling shapes and see how far you can climb."</p>

<p>Avalanche Fiesta was a game developed in Unity/C# in 12 hours as preparation for a Ludum Dare competition.</p>

<p>I worked solo to make a game from scratch and was able to complete my first game jam.</p>
