<h1>Sonder Alpha (2014)</h1>

<p class="italic">"Parkour through a city gathering items and fighting other players in this multiplayer roguelike."</p>

<p>Sonder Alpha was the first large scale project I worked on while learning the Unity 3D engine.</p>

<p>While it is missing a number of vital features and a heavy amount of polish, this project is still relatively large and included a number of unique features like a custom animation system, multiplayer, and procedurally generated levels.</p>
