<h1>Cyberspace Doom (2017)</h1>

<p class="italic">"You have just 60 seconds before the planet is overrun by monsters. Can you survive the horrors of cyberspace in this thrilling FPS?"</p>

<p>Cyberspace Doom was a video game developed in Unity/C# for Wolverine Soft's 2017 Space Jam, a 48 hour Game Jam competition.</p>

<p>I worked on a team of four to build a game from scratch in just 48 hours. I was primarily responsible for programming and 3D modelling.</p>

<p>Our team won 3rd place for our polished mechanics.</p>
