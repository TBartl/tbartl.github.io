<h1>Spring Break Challenge (2017)</h1>

<p class="italic">"The base game, a Mario clone, is functionally set but you can add any aesthetic to it."</p>

<p>The Spring Break Challenge was a competition I created as an officer for Wolverine Soft.</p>

<p>A base game, which I created in Unity/C#, was distributed to club members. Over Spring Break they were tasked with adding an aesthetic over it to make it appear different while remaining functionally the same.</p>

<p>I also participated in the competition, and challenged myself to use 3D art despite the game being functionally 2D.</p>
