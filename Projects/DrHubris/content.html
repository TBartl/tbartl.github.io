<h1>Dr. Hubris (2017)</h1>

<p class="italic">"There can only be one Dr. Hubris! Determine who is the original and who is the clone in this 1v1 real time strategy game."</p>

<p>Dr. Hubris was a video game developed in Unity/C# for Wolverine Soft's 2017 Turkey Jam, a 42 hour Game Jam competition.</p>

<p>I worked on a team to build the game from scratch in the limited time span, working on a number of different features in the game.</p>

<p>The game ultimately won 1st place over 12 teams for its original gameplay and polish.</p>
