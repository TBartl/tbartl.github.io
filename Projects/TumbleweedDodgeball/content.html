<h1>Tumbleweed Dodgeball (2016)</h1>

<p class="italic">"This town ain't big enough for the four of us. Compete with your friends to see who the dodgeball champion is in this frantic
    top-down party game. Special balls, powerups, and a diverse set of levels are sure to keep things interesting."</p>

<p>Tumbleweed Dodgeball was a video game developed in Unity/C# as the final project for EECS 494: Game Design and Development, a major design experience (MDE) course.</p>

<p>I worked on a team of four using the scrum methodology to tackle different aspects of the project from prototyping to polishing
    over the course of 6 weeks.</p>

<p>Our team recieved an A+ on the project for our game's quality, content, and completeness.</p>
