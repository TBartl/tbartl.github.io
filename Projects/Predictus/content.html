<h1>Predictus (2017)</h1>

<p class="italic">"Predictus allows patients with chest deformity, Pectus Excavatum, to visualize the results of the nuss bar surgery."</p>

<p>Predictus was a tool developed in Unity/C# as the final project for EECS 481: Software Engineering, a major design experience (MDE) course.</p>

<p>I worked on a team of four using the scrum methodology to tackle different aspects of the project from prototyping to polishing over the course of the semester.</p>

<p>The tool works by taking an input 3D model scanned from the patient and comparing it with other patients that have already gone through the surgery. Based on the results of those past surgeries, the tool applies the relative changes to the input model to predict what the chest may look like after undergoing surgery.</p>

<p>Our team recieved an A+ on the project for our tool's functionality and quality.</p>
