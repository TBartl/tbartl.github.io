<h1>Where the Light Doesn't Touch (2016)</h1>

<p class="italic">"End the royal family's reign over the animal kingdom once and for all by assassinating every heir to the throne in this puzzle stealth game. Long live the king."</p>

<p>Where the Light Doesn't Touch was a game created in 48 hours by me and 3 other developers in WolverineSoft's Pumpkin Game Jam. During these 48 hours I worked closely with my team to achieve a well-polished and complete game.</p>

<p> I was primarily responsible for developing the aesthetic of the game including the 3D models, but I also worked on the board-state mechanic of the game.</p>

<p>Our team successfully won the competition over 16 other teams for its smooth gameplay, stealth mechanics, and level design.</p>
