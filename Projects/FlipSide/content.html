<h1>FlipSide (2016)</h1>

<p class="italic">"The Prince and the Princess have been separted into separate dimensions! Flip between dimensions to reunite them in this third person puzzle game."</p>

<p>FlipSide was a video game developed in Unity/C# for Wolverine Soft's 2016 Pajama Jam, a 48 hour Game Jam competition.</p>

<p>I worked on a team of four to build a game from scratch in just 48 hours. I was primarily responsible for programming and 3D modelling.</p>

<p>Our team won 1st place for its polish, charming art style, and unique mechanics.</p>
